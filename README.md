Web-based application for users to track product inventory (skincare, haircare, etc.), product use, allergic reaction instances, and reports based on these data.  This project was worked on for two sprint cycles (2 weeks) with a group of 5 members, and is incomplete.  This web application was hosted on the OSU school server, and can only be accessed through the OSU vpn.
